SnakeRL: Reinforcement Learning Agent for Snake Game

Introduction:

SnakeRL is a Python project that implements a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to play the classic Snake game. The agent learns to navigate the game environment using the principles of RL, aiming to achieve the highest possible score by efficiently collecting food and avoiding obstacles.

Features:

Reinforcement learning agent: Utilizes PyTorch for implementing the RL algorithm to train the Snake agent.
Game environment: Built with Pygame, providing a visually appealing and interactive interface for playing the Snake game.
Training visualization: Utilizes Matplotlib to create a graph that visualizes the agent's training progress over time.
Flexible architecture: Easily customizable parameters for the RL algorithm, allowing users to experiment with different configurations.
Modular design: Clean and organized code structure, making it easy to understand, extend, and maintain.
Dependencies:

PyTorch: Deep learning library used for implementing the RL algorithm.
Pygame: Library for creating 2D games and multimedia applications.
NumPy: Fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
Matplotlib: Library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
